As developer we all need to share our knowledge. Sharing is caring.
What better way to do this than with a blog. 
There are many options like medium where styling and hosting is done by other companies.
I prefer to have control over what I create. 
When my current hosting company stops supporting free static sites I can change with minimum effort.

When searching for my own answers online i came across a lot of badly styled blogs.
Partly because using older more proven techniques makes it easier to come back to it.
They hardly need updating which has its simplicity and security advantages. 
Whenever I come back to this project to make a new blog post I likely have node modules to update.
